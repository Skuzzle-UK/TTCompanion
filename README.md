# Tabletop Companion
The purpose of Tabletop Companion is to provide a resource for tabletop gamers.

Initially this will start with an API followed by a Blood Bowl companion app for creating team rosters, tracking team stats through the lifetime of the team and setting up leagues/championships/friendlies while tracking the game results. Players will be able to see their teams standings and stats compared to other public teams. Private leagues will be managable via team invite and public leagues will exist.

## TTCompanion.API
An API for tabletop game data such as the many games published by GW.
